# 01 Planning
  
  - ## Define Concept

      **Concept for a Library Book Management App**
  
        - We propose creating a user-friendly web application aimed at helping library-goers manage their book loans efficiently. This app will allow users to track the books they have borrowed from different libraries, note their borrowing and return dates, and even provide some additional features for a seamless library experience.
        With these features and functionalities, the Library Book Management App aims to simplify the borrowing process for users, foster a reading community, and enhance the overall library experience.

      *Key Features and Functionalities:*

      **1. User Registration and Profile Management:**  
        - Users can sign up using their email or google account.  
        - They can create and edit their profiles, including profile pictures and contact information like city and country.  

      **2. Library Search and Selection:**  
        - Users can search for libraries nearby or by specific criteria (e.g., location, genre, type).  
        - They can add libraries to their favorites for quick access.  

      **3. Book Catalog:**  
        - Users can browse a comprehensive catalog of books available at their selected libraries. (IF API CONECTION V.2)  
        - Each book listing includes details like title, author, genre, and availability status.(IF API CONECTION V.2)  
        - Users can search for specific books and check their availability.(IF API CONECTION V.2)  

      **4. Borrowing and Returning Books:**  
        - They can set the borrowing duration and receive due date reminders.  
        - A scanning feature allows users to scan the book's barcode for a quicker borrowing process.(IF API CONECTION V.2)  
        - Users can mark books as returned when they bring them back to the library.  

      **5. Tracking Book Loans:**  
        - The app keeps a record of all borrowed books, their due dates, and the library they borrowed from.  
        - Users receive notifications as due dates approach or if they are late in returning a book.  

      **7. Book Reviews and Ratings / Community Features :**
        - Users can leave reviews and ratings for books they have read by like.  
        - These reviews help other users make informed decisions about borrowing books.(MAYBE)  

      **10. Notifications and Reminders:**  
          - Users receive notifications for due dates.  
          - Customizable notification settings.  

      **11. Privacy and Security:**  
          - Secure user data storage and encryption.  
          - Strict privacy settings for profile visibility and bookshelf sharing.  


  - ## PLanning Logic (BD STRUTURE)
      Certainly, here's the updated data structure for your MongoDB database in English, including the addition of an image for books and specifying the loan period for each book:

    **1. "users" Collection:**
      - Main Fields:
        - `_id`: A unique identifier for each user (automatically generated by MongoDB).
        - `name`: User's name.
        - `email`: User's email address (can be used as a username for login).
        - `city`: City where the user resides.
        - `country`: Country where the user resides.
      - Subdocument `borrowed_books`:
        - This subcollection will store books borrowed by each user.
        - Each document in this subcollection will have:
          - `book_id`: The ID of the borrowed book.
          - `borrowed_timestamp`: The timestamp when the book was borrowed.
          - `due_timestamp`: The timestamp for the book's due date.

    **Sample Document in the "users" Collection:**
    ```json
    {
      "_id": ObjectId("5f8d70a4e2302a7f385b71a1"),
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "johndoe@example.com",
      "city": "New York",
      "country": "USA",
      "borrowed_books": [
        {
          "book_id": ObjectId("5f8d70a4e2302a7f385b71b1"),
          "borrowed_timestamp": ISODate("2023-09-30T12:00:00Z"),
          "due_timestamp": ISODate("2023-10-15T12:00:00Z")
        },
        // ... other borrowed books ...
      ]
    }
    ```

    **2. "books" Collection:**
      - Main Fields:
        - `_id`: A unique identifier for each book (automatically generated by MongoDB).
        - `title`: Title of the book.
        - `author`: Author of the book.
        - `genre`: Genre of the book.
        - `library_id`: ID of the library to which the book belongs (if necessary).
        - `available`: An indicator of whether the book is available for loan or not.
        - `image`: A URL or path to an image of the book cover.
        - `loan_period_days`: The number of days a book can be borrowed.

    **Sample Document in the "books" Collection:**
    ```json
    {
      "_id": ObjectId("5f8d70a4e2302a7f385b71b1"),
      "title": "Example Book",
      "author": "Jane Doe",
      "genre": "Fiction",
      "library_id": ObjectId("5f8d70a4e2302a7f385b71c1"),
      "available": true,
      "image": "https://example.com/book-cover.jpg",
      "loan_period_days": 14
    }
    ```

    Now, each book document includes an image field, specifying the URL or path to the book's cover image, and a `loan_period_days` field indicating the number of days a book can be borrowed. This extended data structure will provide more comprehensive book information and help manage the loan periods effectively.

## **ANTONOV AN-225 MRIYA ("THE DREAM")**
---
The largest and most powerful aircraft in the world, destroyed by Russians in Hostomel during the attack on Ukraine.
---
The AN-225 was the real pride of Ukrainian engineering, created to transport the space industry equipment and heavy or oversized cargo up to 250 tons. However, in the first days of the full-scale war, Mriya was destroyed by the Russian army. Since then, the image of the Ukrainian bird was used all around the world to support the Ukrainians.
